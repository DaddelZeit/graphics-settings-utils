## FAQ
#### Where do profiles save?

The profile save location is `\settings\zeit\renderercomponents\` in your userfolder.
Only use this to directly back up your settings. If you want to share a profile,
use the designated export functionality in the Profile Manager or Edit Window.

#### How do I uninstall this?
A deinstall and then a restart is enough. The mod will prompt a full deinstall upon removing the mod.
If you want to get rid of all traces manually, clear cache and then delete `\settings\zeit\renderercomponents\` in your userfolder.
This will clear all profile saves and edit history.

#### Can I access older releases?
This repository was created as an archive for old versions starting at V14.
Use the respective branches to view different versions. "main" will always be empty aside from information regarding the mod.
